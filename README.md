# NSS IPS (Infrastructure, Platform, Services) Common Repository 

This repository contains all infrastructure-as-code definitions for our environments. It uses [e.g., Terraform, Ansible] to define, provision, and manage our cloud resources and services.

## About the Project

This repository manages our infrastructure lifecycle, from development to production. Our goal is to ensure consistency, repeatability, and version control for all infrastructure changes. We define resources such as VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Kubernetes clusters, and their associated configurations.

## Architecture

Briefly describe or link to a diagram of the infrastructure architecture. For example:
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (or Azure, GCP)
- **Environments:** Development, Staging, Production
- **Key Services:** VPCs, Subnets, Security Groups, EC2, RDS, S3, EKS, Lambda, etc.

You might include a simple ASCII diagram or link to an external diagram tool.

## Technologies Used

- [**Terraform**](https://www.terraform.io/): For infrastructure provisioning and state management.
- [**Ansible**](https://www.ansible.com/): For configuration management and application deployment on servers.
- [**AWS CLI**](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/): For direct interaction with AWS services.
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/): For containerization of services.
- [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/): For container orchestration.
- [**Your CI/CD Tool**](https://your-cicd-tool.com/): e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins.

## Getting Started

To work with this infrastructure codebase, ensure you have the necessary tools installed and configured.

### Prerequisites

* **Cloud Provider Account:** e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP account with appropriate permissions.
* **Terraform:** [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) (version X.Y.Z or higher).
* **AWS CLI:** [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cli.html) (version X.Y.Z or higher).
* **Ansible:** [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) (version X.Y.Z or higher).
* **kubectl:** [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (if managing Kubernetes).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/darius-napigkit/nss-ips-common.git](https://github.com/darius-napigkit/nss-ips-common.git)
    cd nss-ips-common
    ```
2.  **Configure your cloud provider credentials:**
    * **AWS:** Set up your AWS credentials (e.g., via `aws configure` or environment variables).
        ```bash
        aws configure
        ```
    * *Or for other providers, link to their credential setup guide.*

3.  **Initialize Terraform (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
    This command downloads necessary providers and modules.

## Usage

Here are common operations you'll perform with this repository.

### Terraform Workflows

Navigate to the specific module or environment directory you want to manage.

1.  **Plan changes:**
    ```bash
    terraform plan -var-file="config/dev.tfvars"
    ```
    *Replace `config/dev.tfvars` with your environment-specific variable file.*
2.  **Apply changes:**
    ```bash
    terraform apply -var-file="config/dev.tfvars"
    ```
3.  **Destroy resources (use with caution!):**
    ```bash
    terraform destroy -var-file="config/dev.tfvars"
    ```

### Ansible Playbooks

To run an Ansible playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/production/hosts playbooks/deploy_app.yml
```

### Checking Infrastructure State

Use `terraform state` commands or cloud provider consoles to inspect the current state of your infrastructure.

## Deployment

Infrastructure changes are typically deployed through our CI/CD pipeline.

1. Push changes to a feature branch.
2. Open a Pull Request to `main` (or `develop`).
3. CI/CD pipeline runs `terraform plan` on the changes and posts the output as a PR comment.
4. After review and approval, merge the PR.
5. CI/CD pipeline runs `terraform apply` for the respective environment (e.g., `dev` automatically, `prod` manually approved).

_Detail specific CI/CD process here._
